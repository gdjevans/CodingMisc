    <h3>1. Coding</h3>

    <h3>2. Listening to Music</h3>
    <p>
        It helps me relax and sometimes, focus.

    <h3>3. Drinking Coffee</h3>
    <p>
        I love a nice smooth roasted blend to wake me up in the morning!
        <br/><br/>
        ...and here's a fun fact! I did all three of these things while making this web page. Hope you like it!
